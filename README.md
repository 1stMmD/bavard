# Bavard

I tried creating a Twitter clone with the knowledge I had, my goal was learning as much as I can And when it finished compare it with other twitter clones in the github so I can see what my mistakes are

## What is used for this
* Vite
* React with TS
* Redux Toolkit
* Tailwind CSS
* Supabase

## TODO
* Add Massaging to app
* change post storing and fetching system
* Add email configuration and more providers
* profile popup when username is hovered
* better routing system

### final word
I never look at any tutorials or projects like this so I can challenge myself, there are so many mistakes in this project but im fxing them and learning from them
